# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# this file defines a set of jobs that will run when triggered on a cloned version of your repo
# a job is a set of steps
# by default, there is just one job, and you give it its list of steps

# by default, all branches get build
# but adding a trigger configuration like this says "only build master branch"
trigger:
- master

# a pool is a set of machines for running this job.
# this configuration says: "use Microsoft's hosted Ubuntu Linux virtual machines"
# (we could if we wanted, have it connect to a machine WE control to run the job on)
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# the steps in a job
# "script" is one kind of step - on linux it'll run in bash
# on windows it'll run in command prompt
# give all steps a good display name
#steps:
#- script: echo Hello, world!
#  displayName: 'Print hello world'

#- script: |
#    echo "Showing current directory contents"
#    ls
#  displayName: 'Show directory contents'
